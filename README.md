# Enterprise_Data_Integration
Repo for the Enterprise Data &amp; Integration course in the university of Lausanne. I achieved the grade of 6/6.

This course focuses on integrating various data sources, systems, and applications within an enterprise environment to streamline processes and improve efficiency.

## Course Overview
The "Date Enterprise Integration" course covers the following key topics:

- Integration Technologies: Understanding different integration technologies and methodologies, including APIs, messaging systems, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and middleware solutions.

- Data Formats and Protocols: Exploring various data formats and protocols commonly used in enterprise integration, such as JSON, XML, SOAP, and REST.

- Integration Patterns: Studying common integration patterns and best practices for designing and implementing enterprise integration solutions to address typical challenges and requirements.

- Case Studies and Projects: Engaging in practical case studies and projects to apply the learned concepts and techniques in real-world scenarios.

## Project Work
As part of the course requirements, I had the opportunity to work on a project where I collaborated with ODoo, an open-source ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, and its API.

### Platform Development
For the project, I developed a data platform tailored to the needs of a fictitious user. Leveraging ODoo's API capabilities, I designed and implemented a solution to integrate data from various sources and systems into a unified platform with Node-Red. This platform aimed to streamline data management processes, enhance decision-making capabilities, and improve overall business operations.
